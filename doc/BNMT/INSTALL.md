# How to install

Get the latest release from here:

https://github.com/olanti-p/cata-mapgen-editor/releases

unpack it into an empty folder and run the executable.

Ensure you are using Ultica or Chibi Ultica tileset, and no overmap tileset.
Other tilesets (particularly MSX/UDP family) may also work, but no guarantees.
It is advised to use windowed mode in case the game crashes.
