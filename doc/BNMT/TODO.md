# TODO list

Vague list of what is planned, and what would just be nice to have but not guaranteed.


## UX
- Easier copy/paste operations
- Make all ids selectable
- Automatic window sizing
- Better palette and mapgen import selection dialogue


## Features
- Configure mod list on start
- Edit Nested-type mapgens
- Edit Update-type mapgens
- Allow editing palette symbol (+propagate changes)
- Quick test of mapgen in game (press button -> be spawned in game next to your building)
- Implement all mapgen pieces
- Blueprint autocalc
- Item group editor & tester
- Better vehicle placement preview (graphical tiles; choose which vehicle is visualized)
- Better nested placement preview (recursive placement; graphical tiles and tooltip data; choose which nested is visualized)
- Design simple overmap specials that use the mapgen


## UI
- "Discard changes?" when closing game window with Alt+F4 (right now only asks when closing project with `Ctrl+Q`)
- Draw & manipulate mapgenobjects with mouse
- Localization (may be hard to deal with text layout and rendering)
- Hotkey customization
